    <h2>About GB Labs</h2>
    <p>
      At GB Labs, we work with forward-thinking partners to transform big ideas 
      into valuable technologies. Our team is built around a single belief: 
      every good concept deserves a chance to thrive in the world. By 
      integrating expertise across fields like machine learning, neuroscience, 
      chemistry, and engineering, we move new ideas from speculation to 
      demonstration.

    <h2>Our Approach</h2>
    <p>
      We tackle the <em>explore-exploit tradeoff</em> head-on. We know that 
      mid-to-large companies often focus on products rather than pure ideas, 
      which can limit true innovation. Our goal is to explore interesting 
      directions, validate them with real feedback, and then turn the promising 
      results over to larger teams. This way, profit constraints don't stifle 
      exploration and academic constraints don't slow practical impact.

        <h3>Gianluca Bencomo</h3>
        <p>
          Gianluca is a PhD student at Princeton, where he bridges machine 
          learning, neuroscience, and psychology. With a background in 
          Biochemistry and hands-on experience in robotics, autonomous drones, 
          and electrochemistry, he brings a unique problem-solving mindset to 
          every project. He created GB Labs after seeing firsthand how academic 
          research is underconstrained by profit, while industry often focuses 
          too heavily on profit. GB Labs is his effort to find a creative sweet 
          spot: generate bold ideas and test their real-world utility before 
          scaling them up.
